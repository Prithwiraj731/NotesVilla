# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The NotesVilla application currently has both user and admin authentication systems. Since users should be able to access, view, download, and share notes without needing to log in, we need to remove all user login functionality while preserving admin authentication for secure note uploads and management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a visitor to NotesVilla, I want to access and view notes immediately without having to create an account or log in, so that I can quickly find and use the educational content I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the home page THEN the system SHALL allow direct navigation to the notes section without authentication
2. WHEN a user clicks "Dive into NotesVilla" THEN the system SHALL navigate directly to the notes page without checking for login tokens
3. WHEN a user accesses any notes-related page THEN the system SHALL display content without requiring authentication

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user browsing notes, I want to view, download, and share notes freely, so that I can access educational content without barriers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the notes listing page THEN the system SHALL display all available notes without authentication checks
2. WHEN a user clicks on a specific note THEN the system SHALL show the note details without requiring login
3. WHEN a user attempts to download a note THEN the system SHALL allow the download without authentication
4. WHEN a user wants to share a note link THEN the system SHALL provide shareable URLs that work without login requirements

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to maintain secure access to the upload and management functionality, so that only authorized personnel can add or modify notes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses admin upload functionality THEN the system SHALL require admin authentication
2. WHEN an admin login token expires or is invalid THEN the system SHALL redirect to admin login page
3. WHEN a non-admin user attempts to access admin routes THEN the system SHALL deny access and redirect appropriately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want to remove all unused user authentication code, so that the codebase is clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN the system SHALL have no user signup functionality
2. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN the system SHALL have no user login functionality (separate from admin login)
3. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN the system SHALL have no user authentication middleware for public routes
4. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN the system SHALL maintain only admin authentication components

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user interface designer, I want the navigation and UI to reflect the public nature of the notes access, so that users understand they can access content freely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the header/navigation THEN the system SHALL not display user login/signup options
2. WHEN a user views the home page THEN the system SHALL present clear messaging about free access to notes
3. WHEN a user navigates the site THEN the system SHALL provide intuitive access to all public functionality
4. WHEN an admin needs to access admin functions THEN the system SHALL provide discrete admin access (e.g., footer link)
